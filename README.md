# CrowdSub

The community of crowdsourced subtitle editing!

## User Story

Recently, my girlfriend complained of poorly subbed Korean dramas.
Subtitling of exotic shows are usually done by a few non-professional volunteers.
As a result, these subs are often fraught with errors.

CrowdSub aims to improve this by crowdsourcing the checking of these subtitles!

Just for fun, below is an example of a poorly-subbed scene.
